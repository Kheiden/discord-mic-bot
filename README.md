# discord-mic-bot

Enable stereo sound in a discord channel.

This Discord bot connects to a stereo microphone on your computer, so you can have stereo sound in your channels.

## Description

Discord transmits only mono sound to voice channel, which makes it a bad
experience if you want to sing karaoke or play an instrument in a voice party.
However, bot can transmit stereo sound to voice channel. Thus, you can connect
to your party channel as a bot. (You will need an admin to approve.)

Hey Discord developers, listen to these feedbacks! Shame on you!

### uv - Windows

```sh
%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0
```

Install uv
```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

.\discord-mic-bot-uv.cmd
```

If fail to install
[PyNaCl](https://github.com/pyca/pynacl/issues/637#issuecomment-710127304) or
[NumPy](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1207405/fmod-after-an-update-to-windows-2004-is-causing-a.html)
on Windows, you may need to temporarily downgrade to Python 3.8 until those
problems are fixed.

If on Linux, you also need to install libopus and libportaudio.

## Obtaining a bot token

You need to obtain a bot token to log into Discord's server.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on "New
   Application".

2. Inside the settings panel of your new application, click on "Bot".

3. Create a new bot. When asked about permissions, simply leaving blank is
   enough.

4. Click on "Copy Token".

5. Create a new file named `token.txt` and paste your token inside that file.

## Inviting the bot to a Discord server

Note: You need to have the permission to invite a bot to the destination server.
If you don't have such a permission, the destination server **will not be
shown** in step 4. You can also ask an administrator who has such a permission
to help you invite your bot.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on your already
   created application.

2. Click on "Copy Client ID".

3. Go to
   ```
   https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&permissions=3145728&scope=bot
   ```
   (Replace `<CLIENT_ID>` with your Client ID)

4. Choose your destination server. Then click "Authorize".


## Usage

For Linux or macOS users, `discord-mic-bot` is the entry point.

For Windows users, `discord-mic-bot.cmd` is the entry point.

## Monitoring loudness

The loudness meter is compatible to EBU R 128 / ITU-R BS.1770, showing the
perceptible loudness for the last 0.4 seconds.

```
-70 ================================= -32 ============= -14 ==== -5 === 0 LUFS
 |                Blue                 |      Green      | Yellow | Red |
-70 ================================= -32 ============= -14 ==== -5 === 0 LUFS
```
* The left end is calibrated to -70 LUFS.
* Between blue and green is -32 LUFS.
* Between green and yellow is -14 LUFS.
* Between yellow and red is -5 LUFS.
* The right end is calibrated to 0 LUFS.

For music streaming, it is recommended to aim for -14 LUFS.

But if you are playing the background music while people are speaking, try to
lower down an extra 20 dB. **(i.e., aim for -34 LUFS.)**

This widget is designed to only give you a rough intuition of your loudness. If
you want to seriously measure your outgoing signal, try
[Youlean Loudness Meter (shareware)](https://youlean.co/youlean-loudness-meter/)
for Windows and macOS or
[ebumeter](https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/all/ebumeter) for Linux.

My [live-loudness-normalizer](https://github.com/m13253/sb-jsfx-plugins) plugin
can also help you manage your stream loudness in realtime.
