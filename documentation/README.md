# Bot creation and configuration

## Obtaining a bot token

You need to obtain a bot token to log into Discord's server.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on "New
   Application".

2. Inside the settings panel of your new application, click on "Bot".

3. Create a new bot. When asked about permissions, simply leaving blank is
   enough.

4. Click on "Copy Token".

5. Create a new file named `token.txt` and paste your token inside that file.

## Inviting the bot to a Discord server

Note: You need to have the permission to invite a bot to the destination server.
If you don't have such a permission, the destination server **will not be
shown** in step 4. You can also ask an administrator who has such a permission
to help you invite your bot.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and click on your already
   created application.

2. Click on "Copy Client ID".

3. Go to
   ```
   https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&permissions=3145728&scope=bot
   ```
   (Replace `<CLIENT_ID>` with your Client ID)

4. Choose your destination server. Then click "Authorize".
